# Introduction
BBOA are important for the radiative effect 
but the magnitude and even direction are unclear 
see Haywood et al (2000).
Our measurements set out to add to this body of 
knowledge using Mass Spectrometry data (Allan et al
2001).

# Simulations
John's box model is consistent with coagulation as
the dominant growth mechanism.

# Methodology
We used a whizzbang tool to perform some sick data
collection (King et al 1987).

# Results
Head banging as a result of exposure to heavy metals.

# Figures
This is a section for some badass metal album art.

# Conclusion
Changed the course of music as we know it, ultimately
being killed by the rise of grunge.
